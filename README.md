Getting Started:
[Open up the App](https://shoecollection.herokuapp.com/shoecollection/), and take a look at my shoe collection. This is a database of my shoe collection, from over the years of being a sneakerhead. Feel free to add a pair of shoes that you've purchased alongside with an image. You can also edit and delete shoes as you update your collection. 

Future Features:
Image Uploader
We'll be looking into adding a way to simply upload an image versus just using an image link to reflect images
